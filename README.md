#### Code used to re-analyze published single cell RNASeq (scRNAseq) astrocyte data included in:
Liddelow SA, Marsh SE, Stevens B. [Microglia and astrocytes in health and disease: Dynamic Duo or Partners in Crime?](citation)


## Code
Included is the code necessary to replicate the Seurat objects used for analysis.
- Each R file specifies the version of Seurat used for analysis.
  - where multiple version of Seurat are used this has been noted.
  - Seurat V2.3.4 source package can be downloaded here from [CRAN Archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Seurat/) and installed from local source.

Code included in repository.
- 200629_demultiplexing_mathys_TD.R - demultiplexing code prepared by Taitea Dukstra (TD)
- 200629_mathys_reanalysis_JSS.R - analysis code prepared by Jessica Sadick (JSS)
